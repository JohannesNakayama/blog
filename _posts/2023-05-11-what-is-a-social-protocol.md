* Golems:
    * most famous narrative: The Golem of Prague
    * it involves Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel, also known as the Maharal

* Golem of Prague:
    * the rabbi formed it out of clay and gave it life through a form of magic called Kabbalah
    * its purpose was to patrol the city and protect the Jewish population from antisemitic attacks and pogroms which were frequent at the time
    * legend has it that one day, the Golem went amok and ran rampage, killing many innocent people, until it was finally deactivated by the rabbi himself in dire straits
    * the general historical consensus appears to be that this narrative has been a fiction of German literates in the 19th century

* Richard McElreath used this narrative as a metaphore for statistical testing procedures
* in classical statistics (especially the ones of the frequentist variety), there are often complicated testing procedures that were created with the best of intentions, but when used without care, can be greatly damaging to the scientific process
* this is mostly the case when they are used to draw inference by people who haven't reasoned through what can actually drawn as inference from the test results
* McElreath describes Golems as "clay robots" with "no wisdom or foresight" and calls them dumb and dangerous, even though they may have been built with the best of intentions.

* the Golem is a cautionary tale about the dangers of unintended consequences in creation

* I believe that the Golem is also an apt metaphore for what we call a *Social Protocol*
* whenever online social computing platforms are deployed, we don't just run a computer program that has some deterministic inputs and outputs
* anytime a social component is included in such a platform, I believe it is appropriate to not just think of the resulting system as software, but as a giant part-silicon, part-carbon being that lives in the world and has an impact on it
* we can think of this as a "Golem"

* most online social platforms today are mostly built without taking specific account of these unintended consequences
* many of them do, I believe, have severe unintended and often bad consequences in the world
* they are powerful and destructive
